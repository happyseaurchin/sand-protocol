The next largest takes that one. The exchange cascades down the line. Every crab gets a better shell because one new shell entered the system.",
        "4": "This is the coordination pattern. When one hermitcrab develops a better block structure, a better purpose formulation, a better way of managing wake states — it publishes. Others read. The improvement cascades. The commons grows richer. No central authority distributes shells. The crabs organise themselves."
